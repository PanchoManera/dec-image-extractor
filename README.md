# RT-11 Extractor

Complete toolkit for extracting files from RT-11 disk images (.dsk files) with multiple interfaces.

## 🖥️ **What is RT-11?**

RT-11 was a real-time operating system developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) for the PDP-11 family of computers. This tool helps extract files from RT-11 disk images.

## 📦 **Project Components**

### Core Engine
- **`rt11extract`** - Command-line RT-11 extraction engine (Python script)

### User Interfaces
- **`rt11extract_gui.py`** - Desktop GUI application (Tkinter)
- **`rt11extract_simple.py`** - Web-based interface (standalone web server)

### Assets
- **`images.png`** - DEC logo for the applications

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### Option 1: Desktop GUI (Recommended)
```bash
python3 rt11extract_gui.py
```

### Option 2: Web Interface
```bash
python3 rt11extract_simple.py
```
Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

### Option 3: Command Line
```bash
./rt11extract disk_image.dsk -l          # List files
./rt11extract disk_image.dsk -o output/  # Extract all files
```

## 📱 **Pre-built Applications**

### macOS
- **`binaries/macOS/RT11ExtractGUI.app`** - Native macOS application
- **`binaries/macOS/RT11ExtractGUI-macOS.exe`** - Single-file executable

### Windows
- **`binaries/windows/`** - Build kit for Windows 32-bit executable
  - Run `build_windows.bat` on any Windows machine to create the .exe
